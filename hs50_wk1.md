## Binary
 - Computers use a similar system called binary, where there are two symbols, 0 and 1. Humans typically use the decimal system, with the digits 0-9.
 - our computer has many many switches (called transistors) that can be turned on or off given electricity, and a switch that is on will represent a 1 and a switch that is off will represent a 0.
 - Some years ago the world decided on a standard mapping of numbers to letters, called ASCII.
 - We can also represent colors using a system called RGB, where three values that each represent the amount of red, green, and blue, mixing together to represent some color.

## Algorithms
 - Algorithms are sets of instructions to solve particular problems.
 - we can also look at how efficient this algorithm is. The x-axis is the size of the problem, and the y-axis is the time to solve, and time to solve increases with the size of the problem
